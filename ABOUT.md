# About Interactify

Purpose
Interactify's goal is to provide small, easy-to-understand utilities and patterns that help developers make static content interactive with minimal overhead. It is intended to be framework-agnostic so you can drop features into plain HTML pages or integrate them into larger apps.

Goals
- Keep the API surface minimal and intuitive.
- Avoid heavy dependencies; prefer vanilla JavaScript where practical.
- Provide clear examples that demonstrate common integration scenarios.

Who is this for?
- Front-end developers building prototypes and demos.
- Content authors who want lightweight interaction without a full framework.
- Teams who prefer modular building blocks.
